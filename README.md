# Spam Email Classification

### Objective:

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies emails as spam or not spam using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to develop a classifier that can effectively detect spam emails based on the content of the email.

### Description:

This project utilizes a labeled dataset of emails, which are classified into spam and not spam categories. We preprocess the email text data, convert it into numerical features, and then train different classification models to predict whether an email is spam or not. The models evaluated in this project include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost.
